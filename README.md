# Diabetes Patient Data Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of diabetes patients and building a machine learning model to predict whether a patient is diabetic or not based on various health-related features. The key objectives include performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), preparing the dataset for machine learning, building and evaluating a classification model, and generating meaningful visualizations.

## Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncover patterns, correlations, and insights from the diabetes dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, scale features, and split the data into training and test sets.
- **Model Building:** Develop a classification model to predict diabetes outcomes based on health-related features.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualizations:** Generate visualizations to better understand the feature distributions and model predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about various health-related features of patients, which include:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome
